<h1>Fundementals of HTML </h1>    

<h2> Text Formatting </h2>

<p> A paragraph with <i>some words that are emphasised</i> and <b>some important words.</b> Followed by some <mark>highlighted words.</mark> Feel free to add any other text formatting that appeals to you.</p>

<p> This is some text <br> this is laid out exactly as <br> Laid out at code level without any additional <br> markup </p>

<h2> Special Characters</h2>

<p> The browser thinks that is a programming characters </p>

<h2> Links </h2>

<p> A web page without any links is a unique and peculiar find. You can have links to seperate sites such as <a href = "https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Leeds Beckett.</a> Links to other pages of the <a href ="/study-abroad/" target="_blank" > same site. </a>  Links to another point in the same page.  

<h2> Images </h2>

<p> This image is stored on this server in an image sub-folder.</p>
<p> I hope you added an alt attribute to support screen readers.</p>
<p> Why not check to see what happens if you try to validate your code using W3C Markup Validation Service without the alt attribute included. If you right click on your page and choose inspect or view source you can check your code and see the HTML comment you have added just inside the body tag.
